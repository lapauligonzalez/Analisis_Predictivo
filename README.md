# Descriptive Analytics
This repository contains all the work I completed for the Descriptive Analytics course, including the classes I attended and the final coursework. The final project for the course involved conducting an exploratory data analysis (EDA) from start to finish, which included examining relationships between variables, outlier analysis, multiple correspondence analysis (MCA), and multiple linear regression.

At the beginning, the project presented challenges due to each student having their own .json file for each variable, which contained a substantial amount of missing data and exhibited a significant level of data inconsistency. As a result, the initial data cleaning and missing value imputation stages proved to be quite demanding.
